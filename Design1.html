  <pre>
This is a poem for someone
who is juggling her life.
Be still sometimes.
Be still sometimes.

It needs repeating
over and over
to catch her attention
over and over,
as someone who is juggling her life
finds it difficult to hear.

Be still sometimes.
Be still sometimes.
Let it all fall sometimes.

  <p>Once you’ve got your ingredients and the casserole dish of your choice <code>(I use a 2 1/2-quart dish)</code>, combine two 15-ounce cans of drained cannellini or butter beans, two cups jarred marinara sauce <code>(I swear by Rao’s, but you do you)</code>, and at least a cup of cheese. I like shredded mozzarella or a pizza cheese blend. I’m also very on board with the idea of throwing in a half cup or so of ricotta, which gives the dish serious baked pasta vibes. 

Bake the beans in a <code>350°F</code> oven until the sauce is bubbling and the cheese is melted, about 20 minutes.

<code>Yes to Toppings</code>
I encourage you to put your spin on the pizza beans. Our favorite upgrade is pepperoni slices on top. I like the kind that makes a little pepperoni cup when you cook them. Since pizza is the name of the game here, your favorite pizza toppings are all invited—crumbled cooked sausage, red onions, banana peppers, and even anchovies, if that’s your thing.</p>

        Needlework is a fabulous craft for beginners as you can start with very small and simple designs. Cross stitch is a very simple craft which is created by stitching little crosses into a design. It's quick and easy to master!
